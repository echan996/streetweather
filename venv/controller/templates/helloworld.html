        <h1>History of the Garbanzo Bean</h1>
        <h2>The Complete, Uncut, Unabridged Story</h2>
        <h2>Jinja2 location name is  {{ location_name }}</h2>
        <h3>The Great Discovery</h3>
        <p>The Garbanzo Bean was first discovered by the ancient Brombloms in the summer of 1482. <a href="https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTE4MDAzNDEwNTM0NDk5ODU0/genghis-khan-wc-9308634-1-402.jpg" target="_blank" class="link">Jonkolotong</a>, the leader of the excavation team responsible for finding the bean, noted that it radiated beautifully in the dark. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/son.isaac" target="_blank" class=link>King Mlem</a> of the Bromblom Empire ordered Jonkolotong to hand him the bean. Jonkolotong refused, stating that he wanted to keep the bean for himself. He was executed.</p>
        <p>Shortly after King Mlem took possession of the Garbanzo Bean, he placed it on his bedside table so that his bedroom wouldn't be so dark at night. King Mlem was very afraid of the dark. Within a few days, he noticed that he felt more full of energy than he ever did in his life. And within a few weeks, he started gaining immense physical strength. Soon enough, citizens of the Mlem Empire took note of King Mlem's new, sexy muscles and began to follow his orders without question. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bryan.sanghyuk.kim" target="_blank" class=link>Empress Brean</a> of the Testakle Domain and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AndyHan95" target="_blank" class=link>Prince Penish</a> of the Skrotem Prefacture began to grow jealous of King Mlem's new Garbanzo Bean. And so they formed an alliance known as the <em class="mysterious"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party" target="_blank" class="secondarylink">Uretrah Conference</a></em>.</p>
        
        <h3>The Great War</h3>
        <p>In 1485, the <em class="mysterious">Uretrah Conference</em> began to secretly erect massive research facilities along the coast of the Testakle Domain. The most talented scientists and researchers joined forces to work there to develop a way to annhiliate King Mlem along with the rest of the Bromblom Empire. They worked night and day to accelerate the advent of technology at a rate way beyond what King Mlem could've ever imagined. By 1487, they had invented the steam engine. By 1450, they had sent animals to the moon. And by 1454, they had developed and published "Runescape", a videographic game that was unlike anything the world had seen before. Soon enough, the <em class="mysterious">Uretrah Conference</em> had the technology required to build nuclear weapons. And so, one Monday afternoon in 1459... <em class="scary"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" target="_blank" class="secondarylink">The Great War</a></em> began.</p>
        <p>Within minutes, over half of the population of the Bromblom Empire was wiped out.</p>
        <p>King Mlem wept.</p>
        
        <h3>King Mlem's Request</h3>
        <p>"Stop! Stop it!"</p>
        <p>King Mlem begged and begged on his knees in front of Empress Brean and Prince Penish. "We will not stop," Prince Penish said calmy to King Mlem. "No! I will do anything! I will let you borrow the Garbanzo Bean for a week!" screamed King Mlem. Empress Brean retorted, "No. You must let us borrow the bean for <em>two</em> weeks..." (King Mlem was about to say 'okay fine' but was promptly interupted because he was a hopeless loser haha get rekt) "AND! And! And. You must let us destroy it afterwards."</p>
        <p>King Mlem was devastated. The bean meant everything to him. He took it with him everywhere he went, he slept with it, he ate with it, and he even occasionally slid it in and out of his butthole. But he knew that there was nothing that he could do. He was helpness... Helpless like a little chickpea. "I didn't know this day would ever come," muttered King Mlem. "Take it. Take the bean. I don't even care anymore."</p>
        <p>King Mlem quietly died on the spot for no particular reason. As previously stated, he was a hopeless loser haha get rekt.</p>
        
        <h3>The Destruction of the Bean</h3>
        <p>The <em class="mysterious">Uretrah Conference</em> promptly placed the Garbanzo Bean in a room full of regular dynamite...........? Little did anyone know that a random scientist accidentally put Uranium in the dynamites instead of gunpowder. And it was a lot of Uranium, too. Like enough to wipe out the Testakle Domain and the Skrotem Prefacture and what was left of the Bromblom Empire. So yeah, that's exactly what happened.</p>
        <p>Sadly, all evidence of this story was destroyed that day.</p>
        
        <h3>The Legacy of the Bean</h3>
        <p>As I said, all evidence of this story was destroyed that day.</p>
        <p>The only remnant of this incredible legend is a silly slang term, Garbanzo Bean, which means garbage. This term is used extensively by Isaac Son. He is unaware of the <em>true</em> historical significance of the Garbanzo Bean. Hopefully, he will stumble upon this website one day so that he can learn the real <a href="https://rsmap.net/map/2016/jun02/6/35/18.png" target="_blank" class="link">origin</a> of the Garbanzo Bean.</p>
